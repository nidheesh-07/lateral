# Install the necessary library in Google Colab
!pip install ibm-watson-machine-learning pandas

# Authenticate with watsonx. You would get these from your watsonx project settings.
# A more secure way is to use a credential manager or environment variables.
credentials = {
    "url": "https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
    "apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

project_id = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"

# --- 2. Prepare Data ---
# Load your dataset (assuming a CSV file with 'diagnosis' and 'prescription' columns)
data = pd.read_csv('your_medical_data.csv')

# The Fine-Tuning SDK requires data to be in a specific format (e.g., JSONL)
# You would convert your pandas DataFrame to this format here.
# For example, you might create a file like:
# {"input": "Diagnosis: Common cold", "output": "Prescription: Paracetamol 500mg, one tablet twice daily"}

# --- 3. Fine-Tuning the Model (conceptual) ---
# This part would involve uploading the data and initiating the fine-tuning job on watsonx.
# It's a complex, multi-step process managed by the SDK or API.
# You would define the base model (e.g., 'granite-20b-instruct-v2'),
# specify the fine-tuning method (e.g., LoRA), and start the training.
# The following is a simplified example.
# fine_tuner = FineTuning(credentials=credentials, project_id=project_id)
# fine_tuning_job = fine_tuner.create_fine_tuning_job(...)

# --- 4. Generating a Prescription with the Deployed Model ---
# After the fine-tuning job is complete, you would get the ID of the new, fine-tuned model.
# You then use the `Model` class to interact with it.

# Define the name of the fine-tuned model
# You will get this from your watsonx project after fine-tuning is complete
# fine_tuned_model_id = "YOUR_FINE_TUNED_MODEL_ID"

# Use a base model for demonstration if not fine-tuning
model_id = "ibm/granite-13b-instruct-v2"

# Define generation parameters for the model
generate_params = {
    GenParams.MAX_NEW_TOKENS: 200,
    GenParams.TEMPERATURE: 0.7,
    GenParams.TOP_P: 0.9,
}

# Initialize the model object
model = Model(
    model_id=model_id,
    params=generate_params,
    credentials=credentials,
    project_id=project_id
)

# Create a prompt based on a new patient's information
new_patient_prompt = "Diagnosis: Acute bronchitis, persistent cough. Patient: Adult male, 45 years old, no allergies."

# Generate the prescription
generated_response = model.generate(prompt=new_patient_prompt)
generated_prescription = generated_response['results'][0]['generated_text']

print("Generated Prescription:")
print(generated_prescription)
